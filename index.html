    <p>The story begins by showcasing the close relationship between a middle-aged Iranian villager Masht Hassan and his
        beloved cow. Hassan is married but has no children. His only valuable property is a cow that he cherishes as the
        only cow in the village. When Hassan must leave the village for a short time, the pregnant cow is found dead in
        the barn. Hassan's fellow villagers fear his reaction and cover up the evidence of the death and tell him upon
        his return that his cow has run away. Finding great difficulty confronting the loss of his beloved cow, as well
        the loss of livestock that affects his social stature at the village, Hassan gradually goes insane following a
        nervous breakdown and believes he is the cow, adopting such mannerisms as eating hay. His wife and the villagers
        try in vain to restore his sanity. The film ends with Hassan's death.</p>
